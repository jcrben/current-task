If you want to report a bug or submit a feature request, please check if there is already a relevant issue. If there's no relevant issue yet, feel free to create one. It helps to be as specific as possible. In case of a bug, please provide a reliable reproduction scenario. Please don't be offended if your issue is deemed low priority or out of scope for the application. This just one of my hobby projects, which means I only have a limited amount of time and energy to put into it.

If you want to contribute some code through a pull request, please start by explaining your intentions in a comment on the relevant issue. This way, we can verify if everyone is on the same page regarding the approach and the desired end result. The goal of this approach is to avoid you spending time and energy on a pull request that will later be rejected or that you will be asked to rework significantly. Additionally, this helps avoiding situations where multiple people are developing the same thing without realizing it. For more information regarding the actual development approach, please see the [README section on development](./README.md#development).
