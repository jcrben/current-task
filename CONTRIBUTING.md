If you want to report a bug or submit a feature request, please check if there is already a relevant issue. If there's no relevant issue yet, feel free to create one. It helps to be as specific as possible. In case of a bug, please provide a reliable reproduction scenario. Please don't be offended if your issue is deemed low priority or out of scope for the application. This is just one of my hobby projects, which means I only have a limited amount of time and energy to put into it.

For the moment, I do not plan on accepting PRs from other developers.
